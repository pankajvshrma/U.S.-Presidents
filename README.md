# U.S.-Presidents


This is a report on our Text Mining course term project at Praxis
Business School, Kolkata to assess the utility of a computational analytic
technique called probabilistic topic modeling to identify latent topics or
themes present in a large corpus of textual information. We set out to
accomplish this goal by performing a topic modeling text analysis on a
corpus of 622 key U.S. presidential speeches .
The results of the topic modeling analysis of the presidential speeches
suggest that the technique accurately identified latent themes or dis-
courses across different presidential speeches over time. The results also
suggest that it is an eective tool for producing new insights into the
history of presidential speeches, including nding similarities between
speeches that otherwise might not be apparent.
